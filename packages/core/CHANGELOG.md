# @stdout-design/core

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 49901fa: Update all dependencies to their latest versions, including chokidar 6, framer-motion 14, TanStack Hotkeys 0.18 and Vite 8.3.

  Takumi 2.17: `registerFont` now forwards its abort signal correctly (Takumi inserted a `key` parameter) and resolves to family-name strings as typed, and stylesheets are sent to Takumi as `css` instead of the deprecated `stylesheets` field.

  **Breaking:** `@stdout-design/cli`, `@stdout-design/core` and `@stdout-design/dev-server` now require Node.js 22.22 or later (declared in `engines`), because chokidar 6 and better-sqlite3 13 dropped older Node versions.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Add configurable local/remote font resolution per locale, an image resolver and bounded image fetch cache, and an OG image response pipeline (`core/og`). Improve cache robustness and performance (compile cache, render cache, fs store), and export the new APIs from the package root.
